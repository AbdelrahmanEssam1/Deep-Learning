Subject: Regarding our meeting

Hi Youssef,

I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to make it to our meeting scheduled for 8 am.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Would it be possible to reschedule for 12 pm tomorrow in Alexandria?

Please let me know if that works for you.

Best regards,

Abdelrahman
