Let's start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, the patient has a history of involuntary urine loss, specifically when she coughs or sneezes. That makes me think of stress urinary incontinence. But she doesn't leak at night, so it's more likely to be a functional issue rather than something like nocturnal enuresis, which is usually from a neurological problem.\n\nShe underwent a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. I remember that the Q-tip test is used to assess urethral function. The Q-tip is inserted into the urethra, and the patient is asked to cough. If the Q-tip remains in the vagina, it suggests that the urethral sphincter is functioning properly, meaning it's closing during a cough. If it pops out, it might indicate a weakness in the sphincter.\n\nNow, considering cystometry. Cystometry is a diagnostic test where a catheter is placed in the bladder, and the patient is asked to cough or valsalva to see how the bladder behaves. It measures the residual volume of urine and the detrusor contractions.\n\nGiven that she has involuntary loss on coughing, the detrusor muscle (the muscle layer of the bladder) is probably overactive. So during the cystometry, they might see increased detrusor contractions, meaning the bladder muscle is contracting too strongly, leading to involuntary sphincter activation.\n\nAs for residual volume, since she doesn't leak at night, her bladder capacity is probably normal. If the residual volume was too high, she might have been leaking at night. So, the residual volume is likely within normal limits.\n\nPutting it all together, the cystometry would likely show increased detrusor contractions but normal residual volume.\n</think>\n\nThe cystometry for this 61-year-old woman would most likely reveal **increased detrusor contractions**. This indicates that the detrusor muscle is overactive, leading to involuntary sphincter activation during activities like coughing. Additionally, the **residual volume** would be within normal limits, as there is no indication of excessive urine retention that would cause nighttime leakage.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Fine-tuning","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Updated training prompt style \ntrain_prompt_style = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.\nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request.\nBefore Answering. thing carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response.\n\n### Instruction\nYou are a medical expert with advanced knowledge in clinical reasoning, diagnostics, and treatment planning.\nPlease answer the following medical question.\n\n### Question:\n{}\n\n### Response:\n<think>\n{}\n</think>\n{}\"\"\"","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-27T09:12:56.896411Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-27T09:12:56.896711Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-27T09:12:56.901796Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-27T09:12:56.896688Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-27T09:12:56.901098Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":7},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Donwload the fine-tuning dataset and format it for fine-tuning","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset = load_dataset(\"FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-reasoning-SFT\" , \"en\" ,split= \"train[0:500]\" , trust_remote_code = True)\ndataset","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-27T09:13:01.417724Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-27T09:13:01.418051Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-27T09:13:04.205864Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-27T09:13:01.418027Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-27T09:13:04.205228Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"README.md: 0.00B [00:00, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"9dc0a66b85574a64bc3407eecaac1abb"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"medical_o1_sft.json:   0%|          | 0.00/58.2M [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"881c03d38540497e9c9ec442ed757ead"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Generating train split:   0%|          | 0/19704 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"9ad3519c39064e188c73dc7ddc5ccb87"}},"metadata":{}},{"execution_count":8,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"Dataset({\n    features: ['Question', 'Complex_CoT', 'Response'],\n    num_rows: 500\n})"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset[1]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-27T09:13:04.957208Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-27T09:13:04.957503Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-27T09:13:04.966011Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-27T09:13:04.957482Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-27T09:13:04.965278Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":9,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"{'Question': 'A 33-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after being stabbed in the chest with a screwdriver. Given her vital signs of pulse 110/min, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 90/65 mm Hg, along with the presence of a 5-cm deep stab wound at the upper border of the 8th rib in the left midaxillary line, which anatomical structure in her chest is most likely to be injured?',\n 'Complex_CoT': \"Okay, let's figure out what's going on here. A woman comes in with a stab wound from a screwdriver. It's in her chest, upper border of the 8th rib, left side, kind of around the midaxillary line. First thought, that's pretty close to where the lung sits, right?\\n\\nLet's talk about location first. This spot is along the left side of her body. Above the 8th rib, like that, is where a lot of important stuff lives, like the bottom part of the left lung, possibly the diaphragm too, especially considering how deep the screwdriver went.\\n\\nThe wound is 5 cm deep. That sounds pretty deep. I mean, it could definitely reach down to the lung tissue or maybe the diaphragm. Given that it's midaxillary, we're in the territory where the lower lobe of the left lung hangs out. It's also possible there's some intersection with where the diaphragm begins, but the lung feels more probable somehow.\\n\\nNow, her vitals are concerning: elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. This is serious. My gut says that this kind of vital sign picture could mean something like pneumothorax or maybe hemothorax. Both can happen if the lung gets punctured, and they can make the blood pressure drop and the heart rate skyrocket since she's obviously distressed.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the most obvious culprit is the lower lobe of the left lung. The wound's depth and her condition point that way. And, yeah, this adds up with pneumothorax or maybe blood collecting in the chest—the kind of stuff that can really mess with breathing and circulation.\\n\\nAlright, with this in mind, it sure seems like the lung is the most likely thing that got hurt here. Makes sense given the situation, where the wound is, considering her symptoms, and the whole setup.\",\n 'Response': 'In this scenario, the most likely anatomical structure to be injured is the lower lobe of the left lung. The location of the stab wound—at the upper border of the 8th rib in the left midaxillary line—indicates proximity to the lower lobe of the lung.

We've got sudden weakness in the person's left arm and leg - and that screams something neuro-related, maybe a stroke?\\n\\nBut wait, there's more. The right lower leg is swollen and tender, which is like waving a big flag for deep vein thrombosis, especially after a long flight or sitting around a lot.\\n\\nSo, now I'm thinking, how could a clot in the leg end up causing issues like weakness or stroke symptoms?\\n\\nOh, right! There's this thing called a paradoxical embolism. It can happen if there's some kind of short circuit in the heart - like a hole that shouldn't be there.\\n\\nLet's put this together: if a blood clot from the leg somehow travels to the left side of the heart, it could shoot off to the brain and cause that sudden weakness by blocking blood flow there.\\n\\nHmm, but how would the clot get from the right side of the heart to the left without going through the lungs and getting filtered out?\\n\\nHere's where our cardiac anomaly comes in: a patent foramen ovale or PFO. That's like a sneaky little shortcut in the heart between the right and left atria.\\n\\nAnd it's actually pretty common, found in about a quarter of adults, which definitely makes it the top suspect here.\\n\\nSo with all these pieces - long travel, leg clot, sudden weakness - a PFO fits the bill perfectly, letting a clot cross over and cause all this.\\n\\nEverything fits together pretty neatly, so I'd bet PFO is the heart issue waiting to be discovered. Yeah, that really clicks into place!\\n</think>\\nThe specific cardiac abnormality most likely to be found in this scenario is a patent foramen ovale (PFO). This condition could allow a blood clot from the venous system, such as one from a deep vein thrombosis in the leg, to bypass the lungs and pass directly into the arterial circulation. This can occur when the clot moves from the right atrium to the left atrium through the PFO. Once in the arterial system, the clot can travel to the brain, potentially causing an embolic stroke, which would explain the sudden weakness in the left arm and leg. The connection between the recent travel, which increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis, and the neurological symptoms suggests the presence of a PFO facilitating a paradoxical embolism.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":12},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Setting up the model using LoRA","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model_lora = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(\n    model,\n    r=16,\n    target_modules = [\n        \"q_proj\",\n        \"k_proj\",\n        \"v_proj\",\n        \"o_proj\",\n        \"gate_proj\",\n        \"up_proj\",\n        \"down_proj\"\n    ],\n    lora_alpha = 16,\n    lora_dropout = 0,\n    bias = \"none\",\n    use_gradient_checkpointing = \"unsloth\",\n    random_state = 3407,\n    use_rslora = False,\n    loftq_config = None\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-27T09:13:13.349993Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-27T09:13:13.350735Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-27T09:13:20.726466Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-27T09:13:13.350712Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-27T09:13:20.725671Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Unsloth 2025.6.8 patched 32 layers with 32 QKV layers, 32 O layers and 32 MLP layers.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from trl import SFTTrainer\nfrom transformers import TrainingArguments\nfrom unsloth import is_bfloat16_supported\n\ntrainer = SFTTrainer(\n    model=model_lora,\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,\n    train_dataset=dataset_finetune,\n    dataset_text_field=\"text\",\n    max_seq_length=max_seq_length,\n    dataset_num_proc=2,\n    args=TrainingArguments(\n        per_device_train_batch_size=2,\n        gradient_accumulation_steps=4,\n        # Use num_train_epochs = 1, warmup_ratio for full training runs!\n        warmup_steps=5,\n        max_steps=60,\n        learning_rate=2e-4,\n        fp16=not is_bfloat16_supported(),\n        bf16=is_bfloat16_supported(),\n        logging_steps=10,\n        optim=\"adamw_8bit\",\n        weight_decay=0.01,\n        lr_scheduler_type=\"linear\",\n        seed=3407,\n        output_dir=\"outputs\",\n    ),\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-27T09:13:22.312220Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-27T09:13:22.312514Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-27T09:13:23.431042Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-27T09:13:22.312493Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-27T09:13:23.430249Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Unsloth: Tokenizing [\"text\"]:   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"ed87ae3e00b544f6b8a6acb031f1a184"}},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":14},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Model Training","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Start the fine-tuning process\ntrainer_stats = trainer.train()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-27T09:13:37.654164Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-27T09:13:37.654971Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-27T09:54:46.685418Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-27T09:13:37.654926Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-27T09:54:46.684676Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"==((====))==  Unsloth - 2x faster free finetuning | Num GPUs used = 1\n   \\\\   /|    Num examples = 500 | Num Epochs = 1 | Total steps = 60\nO^O/ \\_/ \\    Batch size per device = 2 | Gradient accumulation steps = 4\n\\        /    Data Parallel GPUs = 1 | Total batch size (2 x 4 x 1) = 8\n \"-____-\"     Trainable parameters = 41,943,040/8,000,000,000 (0.52% trained)\n\u001b[34m\u001b[1mwandb\u001b[0m: \u001b[33mWARNING\u001b[0m The `run_name` is currently set to the same value as `TrainingArguments.output_dir`.

She's a 61-year-old woman with a history of involuntary urine loss, especially when she coughs or sneezes. That sounds like a classic case of stress incontinence. I remember that stress incontinence is usually caused by weak muscles in the pelvic floor, which can't hold the bladder when there's pressure.\n\nNow, when they mentioned she doesn't leak at night, it makes me think she doesn't have the urge to urinate at night, which is more typical of urge incontinence. That's interesting because it suggests stress incontinence is the primary issue here.\n\nThey also mentioned she had a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. I think the Q-tip test is used to check the position of the urethra and how well it's supported. If the urethra is poorly supported, it's more likely to cause stress incontinence.\n\nSo, what do we expect from a cystometry in this case? Well, in stress incontinence, the bladder doesn't empty completely because the urethral closure isn't strong enough. That means there might be some residual volume in her bladder after it empties. This residual volume is a sign that her urethral muscles aren't closing properly.\n\nAlso, I recall that in stress incontinence, there's usually some contraction of the detrusor muscle, but it's not as strong or consistent as in urge incontinence. So, the detrusor contractions might be weaker than they would be in someone with urge incontinence.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the cystometry would show some residual volume in her bladder and some weak contractions of the detrusor muscles. This matches what we expect from stress incontinence, especially since she's not leaking at night and her symptoms are stress-related.\n</think>\nBased on the information provided, the most likely findings from cystometry would be an indication of residual volume in the bladder and weak contractions of the detrusor muscle. These findings are consistent with stress incontinence, where the urethral closure is not strong enough to prevent leakage during activities like coughing or sneezing. Additionally, the lack of leakage at night aligns with the typical presentation of stress incontinence, as opposed to urge incontinence, which is more associated with urge to urinate at night.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":17},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
